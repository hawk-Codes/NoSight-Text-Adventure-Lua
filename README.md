# NoSight-Text-Adventure-Lua
A text adventure game in Lua called NoSight.

This is my first project in Lua.
Just for timepass.

Download Lua's executables from here: https://sourceforge.net/projects/luabinaries/files/5.3.6/Tools%20Executables/lua-5.3.6_Win64_bin.zip/download (Windows)
                                      https://sourceforge.net/projects/luabinaries/files/5.3.6/Tools%20Executables/lua-5.3.6_Linux319_64_bin.tar.gz/download (Linux)
                                      
If you are a Mac user, download from here: https://luabinaries.sourceforge.net/download.html

Add a folder called 'Lua' into Program Files and then put all of the executables and folders inside the zip folder to the new folder (Lua-Program Files).
Add the location to path and open terminal to where you have saved my project.

`$ lua main.lua`
